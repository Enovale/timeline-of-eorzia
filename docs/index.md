# Updated Documentation for Pebble.js

Pebble.js is an alternative to Pebble C development that relies on a connected device to execute code on. It offers a simple and easy start to the world of Pebble development. Here are some important things to know before you start:
- The Pebble app most be open on your companion device for Pebble.js apps to work on the watch. Thus, they are best suited to pulling information from the web such as sports and news data. (HTTP requests)
- Pebble.js apps are a bit more resource intensive and will drain watch and phone battery life faster than native apps. They are also a bit slower than their native counterparts.
- Pebble.js app bundles can be edited by renaming the file extension from .pbw to .zip, so it is very easy to reference existing projects. Also check GitHub!
- For JS watchface development, consider checking out [RockyJS](https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/guides/rocky-js/rocky-js-overview/index.html).
- Note that Pebble.js was still in beta when Pebble folded, so anticipate some weirdness! Don't worry, it's just part of the fun. ;)
